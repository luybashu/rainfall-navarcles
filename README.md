# Rainfalls in Navarcles: Visualisation and Forecasting

This project aims to forecast monthly rainfall using various time series models, including SARIMA, SARIMAX, and machine learning techniques, while also providing an interactive dashboard for public use. The primary objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of forecasting models and to develop a user-friendly visualization tool for Navarcles. Historical rainfall data, including a unique privately collected dataset from 1995 to 2024, was analysed along with external climatic features. Forecasting methods such as Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, SARIMA, SARIMAX, ElasticNET, CatBoost, and LightGBM were tested, with Auto-ARIMA achieving the best performance (test MAE of 29.19). External regressors in SARIMAX did not significantly enhance accuracy. Complementing the forecasting, an interactive dashboard was created using Tableau Desktop (Public Edition), allowing citizens to explore 30 years of rainfall and snow data by year and month. The dashboard provides insights into annual and monthly rainfall trends, drought periods, and snow occurrences. This project not only advances rainfall forecasting in the region but also empowers Navarcles residents with accessible climate data.
