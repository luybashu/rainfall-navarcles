# üåßÔ∏è Rainfalls in Navarcles: Visualization and Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project explores 30 years of rainfall data in **Navarcles**, a municipality in Catalonia, Spain. It combines **time series forecasting** techniques with **interactive data visualization** to both analyze historical precipitation and predict future rainfall.

The project has two key goals:
1. **Forecast monthly rainfall** using time series models (SARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet, Auto-ARIMA) and machine learning models (LightGBM, CatBoost, ElasticNet).
2. **Create a public dashboard** in Tableau to make precipitation trends accessible to residents and local authorities.

The best-performing model was **Auto-ARIMA**, achieving a test MAE of 29.19 mm.

The project is organized into the following folders:


## Key Features

- **Private rainfall dataset (1995‚Äì2024)** manually recorded in Navarcles.
- **Comparison of multiple forecasting models** including SARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet, LightGBM, CatBoost, and ElasticNet.
- **External regressors** (temperature, insolation, lagged rainfall, etc.) explored for enhanced accuracy.
- **Interactive dashboard** developed with Tableau (Public Edition) for public engagement.
- **Python-based data pipeline**, including preprocessing, stationarity tests, ACF/PACF analysis, and time series cross-validation.

  - Manual dataset cleaned and merged with Manresa data
  - Monthly aggregation and missing value imputation

- **Stationarity & Seasonality**:
  - ADF test, ACF/PACF, seasonal decomposition

- **Modeling Approaches**:
  - SARIMA, Auto-ARIMA, SARIMAX
  - Prophet, ElasticNet, LightGBM, CatBoost

- **Validation Strategy**:
  - Time-series cross-validation
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric

- **External Regressors Tested**:
  - Temperature, insolation, rainfall stats, lagged features

## Future Work

- [ ] Add reanalysis or satellite-based weather features
- [ ] Investigate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Temporal Fusion Transformer)
- [ ] Deploy dashboard online for public access
- [ ] Collaborate with local authorities for real-time data updates
